This is Viva.

The problem we are trying to solve is people finding out they have a disease or condition too late in life.
Our solution to this was to build a ML model that flags people for disease or condition based on GP records and emails them the result. We have also made an additional NHS webpage that displays your chance of getting the disease or condition and has a quiz that makes your risk assesment more accurate.

The system we are rebooting is the NHS diagnosis system.

For this project, we have chosen our example disease to be Breast Cancer. We decided on breast cancer because not only is it one of the most genetic cancers, making it easier to predict, but also over 95% survive 5+ years if detected early (Stage 1). Therefore early detection is essential. Additionally about 23% of breast cancer cases are considered preventable through lifestyle changes and 1 in 7 women in the UK will develop breast cancer so it is something that affects everyone and will make a real world impact.
